# Graduation-Project
The main objective of this project is to implement the inverse kinematics algorithm which will be used to animate a 3D rigged model in 3D world. Then implement an algorithm for mapping two different models, where they may or may not have the same deformation system of bones. Coded in C# and used Unity as a platform for the implementation
